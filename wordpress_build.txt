1. Choose a distro - ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS in this case
    -If you are using cloud hosting a shared CPU plan w/ 1CPU - 1GB RAM and 25GB
    instance is enough.


2. After creating your VM using the IP Address ssh into the server.

    Set the hostname of the server
        $ sudo nano /etc/hostname
            wordpress

    In the text file give server a name use the domain name if you have one 
    otherwise just give it an appropriate name.
    You will also need to edit the /etc/hosts file as well.

        $ sudo nano /etc/hosts
            127.0.1.1 wordpress


3. For secrity reasons it is a best practice to manage your server with a 
regular user account and not as root.
    $ adduser murphy
        -Follow prompts to add a new user

    Give your user sudo privildges
        $ usermod -aG sudo murphy


4. Update the server with the latests updates.Note that 'apt upgrade', 
upgrades packages that are already installed and will not remove any packages
on the system. 
'apt dist-upgrade' will fully upgrade the system to the 
latest versions in the repos including the kernel.
  
  Since this is a new install we will do a full upgrade.
    $ sudo apt update && sudo apt dist-upgrade


5. Reboot the server to make sure all the changes we have made will be applied
    $ reboot

If you haven't switch to the non root user now is a good time to do so.


6. Install the webserver
    $ sudo apt install apache2
    
    To check the status of the apache server use the systemd utility.
        $ systemctl status apache2

To check if the server can be accessed from the internet use a web browser to 
navigate to the public IP address of the server. The apache2 default page 
should be visible. The server is using http not https so you will likely get a 
warning from the browser when connecting to the server Ignore this for now.
