1. Choose a distro - ubuntu 24.04.1 LTS in this case
    -If you are using cloud hosting a shared CPU plan w/ 1CPU - 1GB RAM and 25GB
    instance is enough.


2. After creating your VM using the IP Address ssh into the server.

    Set the hostname of the server
        $ sudo nano /etc/hostname
            wordpress

    In the text file give server a name use the domain name if you have one 
    otherwise just give it an appropriate name.
    You will also need to edit the /etc/hosts file as well.

        $ sudo nano /etc/hosts
            127.0.1.1 wordpress


3. For secrity reasons it is a best practice to manage your server with a 
    regular user account and not as root.
        $ adduser murphy
            -Follow prompts to add a new user

    Give your user sudo privildges
        $ usermod -aG sudo murphy
